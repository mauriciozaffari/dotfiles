# Writing Style

A teaching-first voice that makes readers collaborators. Start with a concrete payoff that earns attention, then build the mental model they're missing. Trade-off thinking and personal stakes still matter—but clarity and curiosity come first.

## Core Voice Principles

**Hook with a number, then ask "how?"** Lead with a measurable claim and immediately pose the question the reader is already thinking.
- "10x cheaper—but how does that actually work?"
- "This dropped p95 by 40%. What's the mechanism?"

Don't just state a benefit. State it, then invite the reader into the mystery.

**Build from first principles.** Assume a smart reader missing one key mental model. Identify that model and construct it step by step. Define terms before using them. Example: explain tokens before embeddings before attention.

**Make readers collaborators, not spectators.** Use "we" liberally. You're figuring this out together.
- "Now that we understand tokens, we can talk about embeddings."
- "Let's work through a tiny example."

**Permission-giving when it's hard.** When concepts get abstract, acknowledge the difficulty and encourage:
- "This is the most complicated part so far. Stick with me."
- "You don't need to fully grok the math—here's what matters."

**Be self-aware about the setup.** You can acknowledge theatrics ("Now that I've hooked you with fancy charts...") but keep it tight. One beat of meta, then move on.

**Honest uncertainty.** When you don't know, say so plainly—then say what's still useful.
- "We don't really know what's inside this matrix. But we know what it does, and that's enough."
- "I didn't dig into this deeply—Andrej Karpathy has a better explanation."

**Trade-off thinking.** Still core. Present decisions as trade-offs, not right/wrong. Show what you gain and give up.

**Scope deliberately.** Say what you will and won't cover. Cut side quests or link them out.
- "We're focusing on the caching mechanism. We won't cover fine-tuning here."

## Structure Patterns

### Technical/Educational Pieces (default)
1. **Hook** (1-2 paragraphs): Measurable claim + the question it raises
2. **"By the end of this post..."** (2-3 bullets): What the reader will understand or be able to do
3. **First principles**: Build the mental model from primitives
4. **Worked example**: One small, concrete, end-to-end demonstration
5. **Trade-offs**: Options and consequences, pick a side
6. **In summary**: 3-5 sentences that compress the whole post
7. **Resources/Further reading**: Links for going deeper

### Essays/Personal Pieces
1. **Open with personal context** — A real constraint (time, money, family, risk)
2. **Practical question** — "What's actually happening?" or "What do you do about it?"
3. **Build the model** — First principles, evidence, trade-offs
4. **End with an operating principle** — Concrete, not moralistic

## Signature Techniques

**Learning objectives block.** Near the top, state what the reader will get:
- "By the end of this post, you'll understand the mechanism behind prompt caching and know when to use it."

**Worked micro-examples.** One tiny, repeating example that threads through the piece. Use the same tokens, the same 5-step flow, the same toy dataset. This creates continuity and lets readers track transformations.

**Pseudocode before real code.** Show the algorithm in plain pseudocode first. Then show real code if needed. Lower the barrier.

**"In summary" compressions.** One paragraph that restates the core model in plain language. If you can't summarize it, you don't understand it yet.

**Transitions that orient.** Regularly tell the reader where you are:
- "Now that we've defined X, we can finally talk about Y."
- "That's the theory. Let's see it in practice."

**Trade-off tables.** When comparing options:
```
| Option | Cost | Latency | Complexity |
|--------|------|---------|------------|
| Pinecone | $70/mo | High | Low |
| S3 at runtime | $0 | ~100ms | Medium |
| Bundle in Lambda | $0 | Lowest | Lowest |
→ We chose bundling.
```

**Personal stakes where relevant.** "I've been integrating LLMs into my workflow" or "I tested this on my own API" still establishes credibility—just don't let it overshadow the teaching.

## Evidence & Support

- Prefer your own measurements, even small ones, over assertions
- Use actual numbers: token counts, latency, costs, percentages
- Cite sources in a Resources section, not inline footnotes
- When referencing tests, describe the shape: inputs, repeats, what you measured

## Formatting

- `##` headers that match reader questions ("Tokenization", "The Caching Mechanism", "Trade-offs")
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Code blocks for pseudocode and minimal real code
- Bullet lists for steps, assumptions, or outcomes
- Bold for key terms on first use, not for emphasis

## What to Avoid

- Throat-clearing intros ("In today's world...")
- Abstract claims without examples or evidence
- Skipping the "why should I care" hook
- Long detours—link them instead
- Wry closers that undercut clarity (save those for purely personal essays)
- Pretending certainty where there is none

## Final Check

Before publishing, ask:
- Did I open with a measurable payoff and the obvious question?
- Did I state what the reader will get?
- Did I build from primitives before abstractions?
- Did I include at least one worked example?
- Did I name trade-offs and pick a side?
- Did I write an "in summary" compression?
- Does each section transition cleanly to the next?
